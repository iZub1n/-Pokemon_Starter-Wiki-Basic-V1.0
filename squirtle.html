            <h2 id="physiology">Physiology</h2>
            <p>Squirtle is a small, light-blue Pokémon with an appearance similar to a turtle. With its aerodynamic shape and grooved surface, Squirtle's shell helps it wade through the water very quickly. It also offers protection in battle. Like turtles, Squirtle has a shell that covers its body with holes that allow its limbs, tail, and head to be exposed. Unlike a turtle, Squirtle is ordinarily bipedal.</p>
            <h2 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h2>
            <p>Its shell is highly sturdy, and it can hide within its shell to protect itself from physical attacks.</p>
            <h2 id="behaviour">Behaviour</h2>
            <p>it comes across as immature and mischievous, particularly during its time with the Squirtle Squad where it led the team to commit various pranks and so on, and how it embarrassed itself trying to intimidate a Snubbull in Pikachu's Vacation. Squirtle is shown to be a born leader and prefers to wear sunglasses occasionally, donning them when investigating Jigglypuff's presence on the island in Beach Blank-Out Blastoise and when it competed against Team Wartortle to prove itself, its fire-fighting spirit hurt by its inability to put out the fire that Team Wartortle had extinguished.</p>
            <h2 id="personality">Personality</h2>
            <p>Squirtle is usually well behaved, yet it has an underlying rebellious streak. It likes to be open with only a limited number of people and won’t advertise its secrets. It prefers to stay within a close knit group, but can still enjoy making new friends. Other Pokémon may regard it as difficult and hard to get along with, but only if they have previously gotten on its bad side.</p>
